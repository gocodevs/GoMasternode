<h2>What is Gocoin?</h2>
<p>
Go Coin is building an AI decentralized cloud computing platform for running decentralized applications, specifically what we would consider IoT and Web 3.0 dApps. We believe that these are not just trends in the making, and are preparing technologies that will support both existing and upcoming use cases for technology. Our platform will provide a fully functional marketplace for computing and storage resources for companies and individuals enabling them to share their excess capacity via our decentralized cloud.
</p>
<p>
More importantly, instead of leaving it up to users to perform p2p matching  of the resource transactions, we are applying our expertise in AI technologies to create a Matching Engine that will easily and smoothly pair these resources for application developers. Applications will execute in a secure sandbox on the peer-to-peer resources, with transactions managed on the blockchain via automated smart contracts.
</p>
<p>
Our application marketplace for developers with pre-validated applications will speed up development of end-to-end solutions. We believe that our vision to democratize cloud computing and level the playing field for both resource providers and application developers will become one of the pillars of the next generations of internet technologies
